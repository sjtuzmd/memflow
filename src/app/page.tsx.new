// This is a placeholder to demonstrate the fix. The actual fix would be to:
// 1. Open page.tsx in your editor
// 2. Go to the end of the file
// 3. Add a closing brace `}` and semicolon `;` on a new line after line 1024
// 4. Save the file

// The file should end like this:
/*
    );
  }  // This closes the try-catch block
};    // This closes the function and adds the semicolon
*/

// IMPORTANT: Please make these changes in your local file and save it.
